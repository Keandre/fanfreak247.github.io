  <h1>Keandre Webb</h1>
<p>My name is Keandre Webb, and I'm a software engineer and web developer from Canada. Ever since I was little, I loved the computer. By the time I was 8 years old, I could fully navigate through the computer being able to login, access the internet, troubleshoot and much more. During my high school years, I was able to fix the computer for others, removing viruses and solving problems, not to mention that I could type 107 Words per minute.</p>

<h2>Education</h2>
<h3>Informal Education</h3>
<p>I started Object Oriented Programming at 14 years old. I started with Python and got interested in web development and started with HTML, CSS and a little bit of JavaScript. Along with Python I looked at Java, which I'm pretty good at. I also got interested in C++ and decided to make these the languages that I become best with. To learn, I used SoloLearn, the book "Learn C++ in 21 Days", W3Schools, and other good books and people I could find.</p>
